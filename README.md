# Robotis-Dynamixel-Learning-Robot-Arm
A learning robot arm built with Robotis STEM and Dynamixel servos. The system supports teach-and-repeat functionality, allowing the arm to be manually guided, recorded, and replayed

## Dynamixel Teach-and-Repeat Robot Arm

This project is a learning robot arm built using Robotis STEM components and Dynamixel servos. The system is based on a teach-and-repeat approach, where the robot arm can be manually guided to learn motions, record joint positions, and accurately replay the taught trajectories.

The project is designed for educational purposes, STEM learning, and robotics experimentation, providing a hands-on platform to understand servo control, kinematics, and motion learning concepts.

# Features

Teach-by-demonstration (manual guidance)

Record and replay joint motions

Precise position control with Dynamixel servos

Modular and expandable Robotis STEM structure

Suitable for education and prototyping

# Operating Modes & Buttons

The system uses two physical buttons to switch between operating modes:

Learning Mode Button: When pressed, the robot arm enters learning mode. In this mode, the servos are compliant, allowing the arm to be manually guided. Joint positions are recorded in real time.

Run Mode Button: When pressed, the robot arm switches to run mode and automatically replays the previously recorded motions with accurate position control.

This simple button-based interface allows intuitive interaction without the need for external controllers or software.
